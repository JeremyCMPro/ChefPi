# 👨‍🍳 ChefPI – The Offline AI Cooking Assistant

### Turn leftover ingredients into delicious recipes. Right from your kitchen, no Internet required.

## 🚀 What is ChefPI?

ChefPI is a smart cooking assistant that runs entirely on a simple Raspberry Pi. Just enter the ingredients you have, and get an original, practical, and well-balanced recipe... thanks to an AI that runs **fully offline**.
