Welcome to the ChefPi project !

# 🚀 What is ChefPI?

ChefPI is a smart cooking assistant that runs entirely on a simple Raspberry Pi. Just enter the ingredients you have, and get an original, practical, and well-balanced recipe... thanks to an AI that runs **fully offline**.

> 🍕 Rice, eggs, tomatoes?
> 💡 ChefPI suggests a creative twist on shakshuka.
